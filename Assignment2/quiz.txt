If all weights and biases in this network were set to zero and no training was performed, what will be the average cross entropy on the validation set ? Please provide a numeric answer (three decimal places). [3 points]

5.521
正确回答 
If all weights and biases are zero, the output distribution will be uniform for all inputs. The entropy will then be loge(n) where n is the number of words in the vocabulary. In this case it will loge(250)

In the model trained in Question 10, why is the word 'percent' close to 'dr.' even though they have very different contexts and are not expected to be close in word embedding space? [2 points]

The model is not capable of separating them in embedding space, even if it got a much larger training set.

Both words occur too frequently.

We trained the model with too large a learning rate.

Both words occur very rarely, so their embedding weights get updated very few times and remain close to their initialization.

In the model trained in Question 10, why is 'he' close to 'she' even though they refer to completely different genders? [2 points]

They often occur close by in sentences.

The model does not care about gender. It puts them close because if 'he' occurs in a 4-gram, it is very likely that substituting it by 'she' will also make a sensible 4-gram.
正确 

Both words occur very rarely, so their embedding weights get updated very few times and remain close to their initialization.

They differ by only one letter.

In conclusion, what kind of words does the model put close to each other in embedding space. Choose the most appropriate answer. [3 points]

Words that occur close to each other (within three words to the left or right) in many sentences.

Words that are such that if one word occurs in a 4-gram replacing it with the other also creates a sensible 4-gram.
正确 

Words that belong to similar topics. A topic is a semantic categorization (like 'sports', 'art', 'business', 'computers' etc).

Words that have a lot of letters in common.
